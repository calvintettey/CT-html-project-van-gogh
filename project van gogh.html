			<h2>Summary of the life of Van Gogh</h2>
			<p>Vincent Van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 in Zundert in the southern Netherlands, the son of a pastor. He began to write to his younger brother Theo, a correspondence which continued for the rest of Van Gogh's life.
				<br>
				<br>
				In 1880, at the age of 27, he decided to become an artist. He moved around, teaching himself to draw and paint and receiving financial support from Theo. His style changed significantly under the influence of Impressionism, becoming lighter and brighter. He painted a large number of self-portraits in this period. In 1888, Van Gogh moved to Provence in southern France, where he painted his famous series 'Sunflowers'.
				<br>
				<br>
				He invited Gauguin to join him but they soon began to quarrel and one night, Van Gogh threatened Gauguin with a razor. Deeply remorseful he then cut off part of his own ear. This was the first serious sign of the mental health problems that were to afflict Van Gogh for the rest of his life.
				<br>
				<br>
				On 27 July 1890, again suffering from depression, Van Gogh shot himself. He died two days later.
